# Usage
```java
 new DropDownWarning.Builder(getApplicationContext(), rootView)
                .message("My Message")
                .foregroundColor(0xffffffff)
                .backgroundColor(0xfffe1b1b)
                .interpolatorIn(new AccelerateInterpolator())
                .interpolatorOut(new AccelerateInterpolator())
                .textHeight(80)
                .build();
```

First you need the top level Layout (most of the times it's a relative layout), you will need to give it an id in the XML.

```
RelativeLayout rootView = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.rootView);
```

Next you need to create a DropDownWarning.Builder
To display the warning you need to call:

```
dropDownWarning.show()
```
